      <description>&lt;p&gt;Olga has been coaching in the CSRA since moving to the area from Charlotte, NC&#xA;in 2017.  Her experience ranges from coaching Olympic Weightlifting in a class&#xA;setting, group functional fitness, powerlifting, and a specialization in&#xA;one-on-one Olympic Weightlifting coaching.  Prior to opening a brick and mortar&#xA;space, Olga was providing remote and in-person coaching as well as&#xA;individualized programming. She has developed athletes and coached on all&#xA;competitive levels from local meets to USAW National level events alongside her&#xA;team; Butcher Barbell. Olga founded North Augusta Barbell after seeing a need&#xA;for a dedicated Olympic Weightlifting space in the CSRA. Her passion is to grow&#xA;the sport of Weightlifting and empower athletes to reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
