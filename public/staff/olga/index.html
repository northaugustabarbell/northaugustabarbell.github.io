  <p>Olga has been coaching in the CSRA since moving to the area from Charlotte, NC
in 2017.  Her experience ranges from coaching Olympic Weightlifting in a class
setting, group functional fitness, powerlifting, and a specialization in
one-on-one Olympic Weightlifting coaching.  Prior to opening a brick and mortar
space, Olga was providing remote and in-person coaching as well as
individualized programming. She has developed athletes and coached on all
competitive levels from local meets to USAW National level events alongside her
team; Butcher Barbell. Olga founded North Augusta Barbell after seeing a need
for a dedicated Olympic Weightlifting space in the CSRA. Her passion is to grow
the sport of Weightlifting and empower athletes to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>Olga found the sport of Olympic Weightlifting through CrossFit in early
2016. She started competing in the sport shortly thereafter and has continued to
compete as well as coach the past 10 years. Olga is married and has two middle
school boys.  Read more of her story
