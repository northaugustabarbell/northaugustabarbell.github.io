riding his bike he slowly lost weight, but during this process found CrossFit
and then Weightlifting. Throughout the last six years he has lost over 100lbs,
gained some muscle, and cultivated his love for weightlifting and helping others
find the level of health and fitness they desire. Harley is a dedicated Masters
athlete in weightlifting who puts in the same work as his athletes. He believes
that through hard work and a passion for what we invest our time everyone can
reach their goals.
